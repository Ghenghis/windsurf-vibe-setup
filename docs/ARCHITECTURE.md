# VIBE System Architecture

## Overview

The VIBE system consists of 48 modules organized into 4 main layers, totaling 40107 lines of code.

## Layers

### 1. Core Layer (30 modules)

Foundation functionality including error prevention, idea generation, and performance optimization.

### 2. Hive Mind Layer (12 modules)

Collective intelligence including user preferences, GitHub analysis, and memory systems.

### 3. Evolution Layer (5 modules)

Self-improvement capabilities including project evolution and module spawning.

### 4. ML Layer (3 modules)

Machine learning capabilities including data collection, model training, and HuggingFace sync.

## Module Statistics

| Category  | Modules | Total Lines | Avg Lines/Module |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| core      | 28      | 26173       | 935              |
| hive-mind | 13      | 9108        | 701              |
| evolution | 4       | 2982        | 746              |
| ai-ml     | 3       | 1844        | 615              |

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Event-Driven**: Modules communicate via events
3. **Local-First**: All data and processing stays local
4. **Self-Improving**: System continuously evolves
